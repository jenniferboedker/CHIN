# Predicting Bio-Activity

In order to make a structure based predict on the bio-activity of molecules a list of features is generated with a KNIME workflow. This list is used as input for either a Neural Network or a Random Forest Predictor. In both scripts the input data is splitted into training and test data, 70% of the data is used to train the predictor. Furthermore, the parameters of the predictors are adjusted by GridSearchCV, the predictor is trained multiple time with different parameters and the best predictor is then used to predict the bio-activity. 


## Feature Calculation

The KNIME workflow featureGeneration.knar receives an input containing SMILES and the predicted bio-activity of the molecule in a comma separated csv file. It generates a list of features for the molecules and outputs a comma separated file containing the activity, the SMILES structure the molecules corresponding features. 


## Classification

In order to run the program one has to specify 

-t Path of the input csv file generated by the KNIME workflow 
-o Path to where the resulting prediction csv is saved 

### Random Forest Classifier

```
randomForest_GridSearch.py -t trainingData_Features.csv -o rfc_GridSearch_res.csv
```

### Neural Network Classifier

```
neuronalNetwork_GridSearch.py -t trainingData_Features.csv -o rfc_GridSearch_res.csv
```
